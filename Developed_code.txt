I have outlined a basic architecture and provided sample code for the login system. The frontend is designed using HTML and CSS, the backend is implemented with Node.js and Express, and the database schema is created in MySQL. This should serve as a foundation to develop the login system, ensuring clean and maintainable code following best practices.
