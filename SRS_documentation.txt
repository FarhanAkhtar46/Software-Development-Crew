### Software Requirements Specification (SRS) Document for Login System

#### 1. Introduction

**1.1 Purpose**
The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for the development of a login system. This SRS will guide the development process ensuring that all functional and non-functional requirements are met, and use cases and user stories are thoroughly covered.

**1.2 Scope**
The login system will allow users to securely access the application by providing authentication mechanisms. The system will support user registration, login, password recovery, and session management.

**1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations**
- **SRS**: Software Requirements Specification
- **UI**: User Interface
- **UX**: User Experience
- **HTTP**: Hypertext Transfer Protocol
- **HTTPS**: Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol
- **JWT**: JSON Web Token
- **OTP**: One-Time Password

**1.4 References**
- OWASP Authentication Cheat Sheet
- NIST Digital Identity Guidelines

#### 2. Overall Description

**2.1 Product Perspective**
The login system is a standalone component that can be integrated into various applications to provide user authentication and session management. It will interact with a backend server for user data validation and session handling.

**2.2 Product Functions**
- User Registration
- User Login
- Password Recovery
- Session Management
- Logout

**2.3 User Classes and Characteristics**
- **End Users**: Individuals who will use the application and need to authenticate themselves.
- **Administrators**: Personnel responsible for managing user accounts and handling security.

**2.4 Operating Environment**
The system will operate in a web environment and will be compatible with major web browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge. It will utilize HTTPS for secure communication.

**2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints**
- The system must comply with GDPR and other relevant data protection regulations.
- The system should be scalable to handle a large number of concurrent users.
- The system must ensure data integrity and confidentiality.

#### 3. Functional Requirements

**3.1 User Registration**
- The system shall allow users to register by providing their email, username, and password.
- The system shall validate the email format and check for the uniqueness of the username.
- The system shall send a verification email to the user upon successful registration.

**3.2 User Login**
- The system shall allow users to log in using their registered email/username and password.
- The system shall validate user credentials against the stored data.
- The system shall generate a JWT token upon successful login.

**3.3 Password Recovery**
- The system shall allow users to recover their password by providing their registered email.
- The system shall send a password reset link to the provided email.
- The system shall allow users to set a new password using the reset link.

**3.4 Session Management**
- The system shall maintain user sessions using JWT tokens.
- The system shall invalidate the JWT token upon user logout.
- The system shall automatically invalidate expired JWT tokens.

**3.5 Logout**
- The system shall allow users to log out and invalidate their session.

#### 4. Non-Functional Requirements

**4.1 Security**
- The system shall use HTTPS for all communications.
- The system shall encrypt user passwords using a secure hashing algorithm.
- The system shall implement measures to prevent common security threats such as SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF.

**4.2 Performance**
- The system shall respond to user actions within 2 seconds.
- The system shall handle up to 10,000 concurrent users without performance degradation.

**4.3 Usability**
- The system shall have an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
- The system shall provide clear error messages and guidance for user actions.

**4.4 Reliability**
- The system shall have an uptime of 99.9%.
- The system shall have mechanisms for automatic recovery in case of failure.

#### 5. Use Cases

**5.1 Use Case: User Registration**
- **Actors**: End User
- **Preconditions**: None
- **Main Flow**:
  1. User navigates to the registration page.
  2. User fills in the registration form and submits it.
  3. System validates the input data.
  4. System stores the user data and sends a verification email.
  5. User clicks the verification link in the email.
  6. System verifies the email and activates the user account.
- **Postconditions**: User account is created and activated.

**5.2 Use Case: User Login**
- **Actors**: End User
- **Preconditions**: User account is activated.
- **Main Flow**:
  1. User navigates to the login page.
  2. User enters email/username and password.
  3. System validates the credentials.
  4. System generates a JWT token and logs in the user.
- **Postconditions**: User is logged in and a session is created.

**5.3 Use Case: Password Recovery**
- **Actors**: End User
- **Preconditions**: User account exists.
- **Main Flow**:
  1. User navigates to the password recovery page.
  2. User enters the registered email.
  3. System sends a password reset link to the email.
  4. User clicks the reset link and sets a new password.
- **Postconditions**: User password is updated.

**5.4 Use Case: Logout**
- **Actors**: End User
- **Preconditions**: User is logged in.
- **Main Flow**:
  1. User clicks the logout button.
  2. System invalidates the JWT token and ends the session.
- **Postconditions**: User is logged out.

#### 6. User Stories

**6.1 As a user, I want to register an account so that I can access the application.**
**6.2 As a user, I want to log in to my account so that I can access my personal data.**
**6.3 As a user, I want to recover my password so that I can regain access if I forget it.**
**6.4 As a user, I want to log out of my account so that my session is secure.**
