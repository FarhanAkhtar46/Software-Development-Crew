   - Authentication Server: Authentication Module, Session Manager, Security Module, Logging and Monitoring
   - Database: User Table, Session Table, Logs Table

3. **Sequence Diagrams:**
   - User Login Sequence: Detailed step-by-step interactions between user, client application, authentication server, and database.

4. **Data Flow Diagrams:**
   - Level 0 DFD: High-level context diagram showing data flow between user, client application, authentication server, and database.
   - Level 1 DFD: Detailed data flow including user input, data validation, authentication request, session management, and response handling.

This design is intended to be scalable and meet typical login functionality requirements. For a more tailored design, specific details from the SRS document are needed.
