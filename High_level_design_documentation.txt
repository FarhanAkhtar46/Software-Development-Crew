### System Architecture Design for School Management System

#### 1. High-Level Design
The School Management System (SMS) will be a web-based application with the following key components:
- **User Interface (UI) Layer**: Web and Mobile interfaces for administrators, teachers, students, and parents.
- **Application Layer**: Core business logic, typically implemented as microservices.
- **Data Access Layer**: Handles communication with the database.
- **Database**: Centralized repository for all school-related data.
- **External Services**: Integration with third-party services like email, SMS, and payment gateways.

#### 2. Component Diagrams
The component diagram models the physical components of the system. Below are the main components:

- **User Interface Components**:
  - Web Application
  - Mobile Application

- **Application Services**:
  - Authentication Service
  - Student Management Service
  - Teacher Management Service
  - Course Management Service
  - Attendance Management Service
  - Grades Management Service
  - Notification Service

- **Data Access Components**:
  - ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for database interaction

- **Database**:
  - SQL/NoSQL Database

- **External Services**:
  - Email Service
  - SMS Gateway
  - Payment Gateway

#### Component Diagram

```
[User Interface]
    |--- Web Application
    |--- Mobile Application

[Application Services]
    |--- Authentication Service
    |--- Student Management Service
    |--- Teacher Management Service
    |--- Course Management Service
    |--- Attendance Management Service
    |--- Grades Management Service
    |--- Notification Service

[Data Access Components]
    |--- ORM

[Database]
    |--- SQL/NoSQL Database

[External Services]
    |--- Email Service
    |--- SMS Gateway
    |--- Payment Gateway
```

#### 3. Sequence Diagrams
Sequence diagrams show interactions between different components for specific use cases.

**Example Use Case: Student Registration**

1. User (Admin) initiates registration via the Web Application.
2. Web Application sends the registration request to the Student Management Service.
3. Student Management Service validates the request.
4. If valid, Student Management Service sends data to the ORM.
5. ORM interacts with the database to store student information.
6. Database confirms the transaction.
7. ORM sends confirmation back to the Student Management Service.
8. Student Management Service sends confirmation back to the Web Application.
9. Web Application displays confirmation to the Admin.

#### Sequence Diagram: Student Registration

```
Admin -> Web Application: Initiate Registration
Web Application -> Student Management Service: Send Registration Data
Student Management Service -> ORM: Validate and Store Data
ORM -> Database: Store Data
Database -> ORM: Data Stored Confirmation
ORM -> Student Management Service: Confirmation Received
Student Management Service -> Web Application: Registration Successful
Web Application -> Admin: Display Confirmation
```

#### 4. Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)
Data Flow Diagrams represent the flow of information within the system.

**Level 0 (Context Diagram)**

```
[User] --(Request/Response)--> [School Management System] --(Data Storage/Access)--> [Database]
```

**Level 1 (High-Level DFD)**

```
[Admin] --(Manage Students)--> [Student Management Service] --(Store/Retrieve)--> [Database]
[Teacher] --(Manage Courses)--> [Course Management Service] --(Store/Retrieve)--> [Database]
[Student] --(View Grades)--> [Grades Management Service] --(Store/Retrieve)--> [Database]
[Parent] --(Receive Notifications)--> [Notification Service] --(Send)--> [Email/SMS Gateway]
```

### Conclusion
The designed system architecture and flow diagrams ensure a scalable and modular School Management System. Each component is designed to handle specific responsibilities, promoting maintainability and extensibility. The use of microservices ensures that the system can scale as needed to accommodate growing user bases and additional features.
