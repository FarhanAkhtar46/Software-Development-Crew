### System Architecture Design for Login/Signup Page

#### 1. High-Level Design:
The high-level design of the login/signup system includes the following components:
- **Client-Side Application**: The frontend user interface where users interact with the system.
- **API Gateway**: Acts as a reverse proxy to route requests from the client-side to the appropriate backend services.
- **Authentication Service**: Responsible for handling login, signup, and token management.
- **Database**: Stores user credentials, profile information, and other necessary data.
- **Email Service**: Sends confirmation emails for account verification and password reset.

#### 2. Component Diagram:
The component diagram consists of the following components and their interactions:

```
+---------------------------------+
|           Client-Side           |
|  - UI for Login/Signup          |
+---------------------------------+
               |
               v
+---------------------------------+
|         API Gateway             |
|  - Routes requests to services  |
+---------------------------------+
               |
               v
+---------------------------------+        +---------------------+
|     Authentication Service      |<----->|       Database       |
|  - Handles login/signup         |       |  - User credentials  |
|  - Generates JWT tokens         |       |  - Profile info      |
+---------------------------------+        +---------------------+
               |
               v
+---------------------------------+
|         Email Service           |
|  - Sends confirmation emails    |
|  - Sends password reset emails  |
+---------------------------------+
```

#### 3. Sequence Diagram:
The sequence diagrams for both login and signup processes are provided below.

**Login Sequence Diagram:**
```
Client-Side -> API Gateway: Submit login form (email & password)
API Gateway -> Authentication Service: Forward login request
Authentication Service -> Database: Verify credentials
Database -> Authentication Service: Credentials valid/invalid
Authentication Service -> API Gateway: Return JWT token or error
API Gateway -> Client-Side: Return JWT token or error
```

**Signup Sequence Diagram:**
```
Client-Side -> API Gateway: Submit signup form (email, password, etc.)
API Gateway -> Authentication Service: Forward signup request
Authentication Service -> Database: Store user data
Database -> Authentication Service: User data stored
Authentication Service -> Email Service: Send confirmation email
Email Service -> Client-Side: Confirmation email sent
Authentication Service -> API Gateway: Return success message
API Gateway -> Client-Side: Return success message
```

#### 4. Data Flow Diagram:
The data flow diagram outlines the flow of data within the system for both login and signup processes.

**Login Data Flow Diagram:**
```
User (email, password) --> [Client-Side]
[Client-Side] --> [API Gateway]
[API Gateway] --> [Authentication Service]
[Authentication Service] --> [Database] (Verify credentials)
[Database] --> [Authentication Service] (Credentials valid/invalid)
[Authentication Service] --> [API Gateway] (JWT token or error)
[API Gateway] --> [Client-Side] (JWT token or error)
```

**Signup Data Flow Diagram:**
```
User (email, password, etc.) --> [Client-Side]
[Client-Side] --> [API Gateway]
[API Gateway] --> [Authentication Service]
[Authentication Service] --> [Database] (Store user data)
[Database] --> [Authentication Service] (User data stored)
[Authentication Service] --> [Email Service] (Send confirmation email)
[Email Service] --> [Client-Side] (Confirmation email sent)
[Authentication Service] --> [API Gateway] (Success message)
[API Gateway] --> [Client-Side] (Success message)
```

This design ensures that the system is scalable, secure, and meets the requirements as outlined in the SRS document.
