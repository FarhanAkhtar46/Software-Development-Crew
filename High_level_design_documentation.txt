### System Architecture Design for School Management System

#### High-Level Design:
The School Management System (SMS) is designed to manage and facilitate the administration of school operations. The system will have a web-based interface accessible by different user roles such as Admin, Teachers, Students, and Parents. The architecture will be based on a client-server model, which includes the following main components:

1. **Client-Side (Frontend):**
   - User Interfaces for different roles (Admin, Teacher, Student, Parent)
   - Web Browser or Mobile App

2. **Server-Side (Backend):**
   - Web Server (e.g., Apache, Nginx)
   - Application Server (e.g., Node.js, Django, Spring Boot)
   - Database Server (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB)
   - Authentication and Authorization Service (e.g., OAuth2, JWT)
   - Notification Service (e.g., Email, SMS)

3. **External Services:**
   - Payment Gateway Integration
   - Third-Party APIs (e.g., Google Maps for location services)

#### Component Diagram:
The component diagram represents the high-level structure of the School Management System and its interaction with various external components.
